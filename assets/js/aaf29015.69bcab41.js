Studies consistently demonstrate that humans can effectively manage only a limited number of novel concepts simultaneously in working memory, typically between 5-7 distinct items. By deliberately constraining change scope to fit within these cognitive limitations, the baby steps approach ensures developers can fully comprehend each modification without exceeding their cognitive capacity. This constraint directly addresses the common programming experience of becoming lost in complex changes, where developers lose track of their original intention or overlook subtle interactions between multiple modifications happening simultaneously."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"implementation-techniques",children:"Implementation Techniques"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Effective implementation of the baby steps approach requires specific techniques that maintain progress while enforcing appropriately small change increments. The time-boxing technique establishes strict time limits (typically 2-5 minutes) for completing a cohesive change including tests, with a reset to the previous stable state if completion isn't achieved within the timeframe. Micro-committing workflows capture each small change in version control as soon as tests pass, creating a granular history that enables precise navigation through the development process. Advanced practitioners combine these techniques with automated testing frameworks that provide nearly instantaneous feedback, allowing rapid verification that each small step maintains system correctness before proceeding to the next modification."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"learning-curve-considerations",children:"Learning Curve Considerations"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Teams adopting the baby steps approach typically progress through predictable learning stages before achieving mastery of this seemingly simple but challenging discipline. Initially, developers often resist the approach's constraints, perceiving them as unnecessarily slowing progress compared to making larger changes. The intermediate stage brings recognition of the method's benefits as teams experience fewer integration problems and debugging sessions, though they still struggle with consistently defining appropriately-sized steps. Mastery emerges as developers develop intuition for natural \"seams\" in problems that suggest logical step boundaries, allowing them to move quickly through sequences of small changes while maintaining control and visibility throughout the development process. Organizations supporting this learning curve often pair more experienced practitioners with newcomers, providing living examples of effective incremental development rather than merely prescribing the approach abstractly."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.h2,{id:"further-reading",children:"Further reading"}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.ol,{children:["\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.li,{children:["\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.p,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"Incremental Software Development Strategies for Large Scale Refactoring"}),": This article discusses how baby steps can be used for large-scale refactoring by performing small, incremental changes to maintain system stability",(0,s.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://philippe.bourgau.net/incremental-software-development-strategies-for-large-scale-refactoring-number-2-baby-steps/",children:"1"}),"."]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.li,{children:["\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.p,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"How To Fix Bad Agile By Discussing Baby Steps"}),": This blog post explores how baby steps can improve agile practices by focusing on small, manageable changes to the code",(0,s.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-fix-bad-agile-by-discussing-baby-steps/",children:"2"}),"."]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.li,{children:["\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.p,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"Taking Baby Steps++"}),": This article from Codecentric discusses the use of baby steps in Test-Driven Development (TDD) and how it helps maintain progress and control",(0,s.jsx)(n.a,{href:"https://www.codecentric.de/knowledge-hub/blog/taking-baby-steps",children:"3"}),"."]}),"\n"]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:"I hope you find these resources helpful!

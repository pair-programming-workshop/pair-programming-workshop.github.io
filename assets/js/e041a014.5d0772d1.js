Physical implementations often use magnetic whiteboards with developer name magnets arranged in a stair-step pattern showing current and historical pairings, providing an always-visible reference point during daily activities. Digital implementations range from simple shared spreadsheets to specialized tools integrated with project management systems that automatically track pairing patterns and provide analytics on knowledge distribution.

The historical view enables teams to identify potential knowledge silos when certain individuals consistently avoid working together or on specific system components.

Senior developers frequently discover gaps in their fundamental understanding when explaining concepts, reinforcing their own knowledge through the teaching process.

The emotional context of collaborative problem-solving creates stronger memory formation than passive learning, with the brain's reward systems activated by joint accomplishment. Perhaps most significantly, the continuous feedback loop allows immediate correction of misunderstandings that might otherwise persist for months in traditional learning environments, preventing the formation of incorrect mental models that would later require extensive unlearning."})]})}function g(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,t.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,t.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}}}]);
